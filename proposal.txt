PROBLEM: what exactly do we mean by "popular music" here? all popular-ish genres
from the particular country? or just top 40 stuff?


idea: use machine learning to distinguish (modern?) popular music from different countries
for example, is it possible to distinguish K-pop from Canto-pop/Mando-pop/J-pop/T-pop?
Or if this is unsuccessful, broaden the set of countries whose popular music we compare.

This is worthwhile and interesting for two primary reasons:
1) we can build upon a large amount of work on auto-tagging by trying to improve
one particular aspect (country of origin)
2) presuming we trust our software, we can get a numerical sense for how similar/
different popular music from differents is. (for example, is K-pop quantitatively
more like American popular music than J-pop is?)

Some ideas we have/how we plan to do this:
In terms of features, we were recommended by Jonathan Berger at CCRMA to look at
the http://www.ismir.net (the society for music information retrieval) conference
and specifically at Doug Eck's work. As such, we have found the following two papers:
http://ismir2011.ismir.net/papers/PS6-13.pdf
http://ismir2012.ismir.net/event/papers/553-ismir-2012.pdf
we'll start with some features (such as things related to the mel spectrum)
inspired from the paper and if those do not prove fruitful experiment further

we think it'd be most interesting to try unsupervised learning, especially on 
countries whose popular music may seem especially similar to the average American.
k-means seems like a good idea. we've also heard things about convolutional neural nets,
so maybe we'll try some of those?

if unsupervised learning is not fruitful even after we try to compare things like
swedish and indian music (which we presume to be very different), we might try to
help it along and add some supervision.
